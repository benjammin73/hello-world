I am Rousteffo Guadalajara, and yes, I am German. I come from the village of Quedlinburg where my family raised goats and wore lederhosen unironically. For years, I resented both my family and our goats, but after the outbreak of mad goat disease and the death of the goats and both my father and youngest sister, I too began to wear lederhosen unironically. It's what my father would have wanted, and my sister always loved her lederhosen. Soon after this tragedy, an American man named Kraft came to our small goat farm (we had bought new goats with father's life insurance. He was just buried in the backyard) and asked us to relocate to America where he would use our goats in his cheese business. We packed up and left, but our endeavors failed. Americans didn't want goat cheese; They wanted yellow plastic. Our family was ruined, and now only my 6th youngest brother and I remain. Our only desire in life is to destroy the man named Kraft and his cheap yellow plastic business. We have legally changed our names and designed an elaborate new background for ourselves, and we have just started working at Kraft Corporate headquarters. In time, we will climb this corporate ladder and ruin the business from the inside out.. with our feces. We are the Kraft Krappers!
